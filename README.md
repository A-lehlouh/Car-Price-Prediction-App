# Car-Price-Prediction-App
 This is a Streamlit-based machine learning web app that predicts the market price of a used car based on key input features like manufacturer, engine volume, fuel type, mileage, and production year. The project also includes visual analytics to explore market trends and gain insights into car pricing patterns.

##  Features

-  Predict used car prices using machine learning
-  User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**
-  Categorical data is handled automatically using one-hot encoding
-  Real-time data visualizations using **Matplotlib**  
-  Three key visualizations included:
  - **Bar chart** of car counts by manufacturer
  - **Line chart** of average price by production year
  - **Scatter plot** showing price vs. mileage
